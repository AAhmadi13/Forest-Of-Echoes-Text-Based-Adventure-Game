A Python-based, text-based adventure game that immerses the player in a rich, command-line environment. The game uses a functional and declarative programming approach to manage player interactions, narrative choices, and state transitions, ensuring a modular and robust architecture. 

<br>

**Core Gameplay Mechanics**

- Story Progression & Branching Endings - Player choices shape a dynamic narrative with multiple outcomes, including fatal, bittersweet, and victorious endings.

- Item Interaction - Collect, examine, and use items like the Heart of Yurei or the Enchanted Sword to solve puzzles and unlock new paths.

- Maze Navigation - A data-driven maze system challenges players with traps and obstacles, leading to a significant reward upon completion.

**Software Design**

- Declarative & Functional Programming - The game's logic is driven by data structures (dictionaries and lambdas) and pure functions, avoiding mutable state and hardcoded control flow.

- Data Modelling - The game world, player state, and behaviours are formally modelled using Set Theory and Graph Theory to ensure logical consistency and reliability.

- Command Handling - User input is interpreted by a central, data-mapped command dictionary that routes commands to the appropriate functions, making the system highly extensible.

**Project Highlights**

- Comprehensive Testing - Automated unit tests using pytest validate core mechanics like movement, item usage, and maze logic, ensuring the game behaves as designed under various conditions.

- State Management - A central state dictionary is passed explicitly to all functions, preventing side effects and making the game's state easy to track, save, and load.

- Scalable Architecture - The declarative design allows new features, rooms, and items to be added by simply updating data, without modifying the core game engine.
