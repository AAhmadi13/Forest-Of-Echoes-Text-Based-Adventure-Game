# Forest-Of-Echoes-Text-Based-Adventure-Game
Python Text-Based Adventure Game


NEED TO ADD/ FIX IN SRC V1:

1. Fix Colour position (make it so the colour is next to each option)
2. Storing and using items in the inventory
3. Examining items for information or clues
4. Accessing help for available commands
5. MUD Multi-User Dungeon - Plan and implement the game from being a single-player text adventure into a multi
player Multi-user dungeon (“MUD”) – this would mean that the game would benefit from 
being designed “from the ground-up” as capable of networking.
6. A save game feature allowing you to continue a previous game from the last time it was 
saved 
7.
