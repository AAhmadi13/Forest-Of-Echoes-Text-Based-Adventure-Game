13. When you are in the final fight/ battle, it should prompt the user to absorb the 'heart of yurei' before getting into the battle, so the story makes more sense. **(recommendation: Put the sword in use so if the user does not choose or take the 'heart of yurei', it holds a consequence of losing the traveller due to the lack of power, which you would not suffer if the user chooses to take and absorb 'heart of yurei'.)** -                                                                   ✅ **[STEVE]**

23. Fixed the dialogue so that the traveller isn't mentioned again if the player has already freed the traveller - ✅ **[ADAM]**
24. Fixed it so if the player has taken the 'heart of yurei' and visited the 'deep cave' again, it will show a different dialogue, so it shows that the heart has been taken - ✅ **[ADAM]**
25. Fixed it so that if the player has opened the locked gate already within the 'glowing cave' and revisits the room, it will show a different dialogue so that it shows the gate is open - ✅ **[ADAM]**
26. Fixed it so that at the end of the game, it allows users to play again with a prompt - ✅ **[ADAM]**
27. MUD Multi-User Dungeon - Plan and implement the game from being a single-player text adventure into a multi-player Multi-user dungeon (“MUD”) – this would mean that the game would benefit from being designed “from the ground-up” as capable of networking - ❌
