Welcome to the Forest of Echoes.

You are Alex, a seasoned scavenger seeking the legendary treasure known as the Heart of Yurei.
Beside you is Kai, your fellow explorer, both determined to reach the peak of the elusive Mount Duskveil.

To get there, however, you must survive the Forest of Echoesâ€”a place of ancient secrets, mythical beasts,
and paths that twist reality.

Each decision will shape your destiny. Choose wisely.
